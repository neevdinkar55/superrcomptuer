     <input type="text" id="text-to-speak" value="A supercomputer is
     the fastest computer in the world that can process
     a significant amount of data very quickly.
      The computing Performance of a “supercomputer”
     is measured very high as compared to a general
     purpose computer. The computing Performance of a
     supercomputer is measured in FLOPS (that is 
     floating-point operations per second) instead 
     of MIPS. The supercomputer consists of tens of 
     thousands of processors which can perform billions
     and trillions of calculations per second, or you
     can say that supercomputers can deliver up to nearly
     a hundred quadrillions.
     
     WORLDS SUPER FAST COMPUTER
     The Beating Heart of the World’s First Exascale Supercomputer.
     The world’s latest fastest supercomputer, Frontier at Oak Ridge National Lab, 
     in Tennessee, is so powerful that it operates faster than the next seven best 
     supercomputers combined and more than twice as well as the Nunber 2. Frontier
     is not only the first machine to break the exascale barrier, a threshold of a
     billion calculations per second, but is also ranked No. 1 as the world’s most 
     energy-efficient supercomputer. Now the companies that helped build Frontier,
     Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), reveal the
     electronic tricks that make the supercomputer tick.consists of 74 HPE Cray EX 
     supercomputing cabinets, each weighing more than 3,600 kilograms, which altogether
      hold more than 9,400 computing nodes. Each node contains one optimized third-generation
       AMD EPYC 64-core 2-gigahertz “Trento” processor for general tasks and four AMD instinct 
       MI250x accelerators for highly parallel supercomputing and AI operations, as well as 
       4 terabytes of flash memory to help quickly feed the GPUs data. In total, Frontier 
       contains 9,408 CPUs, 37,632 GPUs, and 8,730,112 cores, linked together by 145 kilometers 
       of networking cables. The lab says its world-leading supercomputer consumes about 21 megawatts.
        
        Its proud to hear that india too have a super computeer,
        named as AIRAWAT
        
        INDIA'S SUPER FAST COMPUTER
        AIRAWAT
        Supercomputing in India has a history going back to the 1980s.
        The Government of India created an indigenous development
        programme as they had difficulty purchasing foreign supercomputers.
        As of June 2023, the AIRAWAT supercomputer is the fastest supercomputer 
        in India, having been ranked 75th fastest in the world in the TOP500 supercomputer
        list. AIRAWAT has been installed at the Centre for Development of Advanced
        Computing (C-DAC) in Pune."
